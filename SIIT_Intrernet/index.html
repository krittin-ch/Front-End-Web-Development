        <h1>Ethical use of SIIT computers and networks</h1>
        <p>Access to computing and network facilities both within SIIT and beyond the campuses, sharing of information, and security of the intellectual products of the community all require that users accept the responsibility to protect the rights of the community. Although computers affect how we communicate and interact with each other, computers do not change underlying societal values and established individual rights.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Any member of SIIT community who, without authorization, accesses, uses, destroys, alters, dismantles, or disfigures computing or network facilities has engaged in unethical and unacceptable conduct. These acts also threaten the atmosphere of increased access to information and threaten the security within which members of the community may create intellectual products and store information.</p>
